# Scheduler 2.0 Planning

## Things that suck about Scheduler 1.0

1. No user account
2. Can't book past a week
3. There is no way to book outside the hours of 12pm - 5pm
4. No information on interviewers
5. No way to view calendar for a given instructor
6. No email notifications
7. No way to pay interviewers? ( Not sure why in a real world setting you would need to pay them because they are employed by the school, but useful beyond the current scope )

## Purpose

Purpose of app: To help users (clients) book appointments with other users (service provider)

User types:

- Student (client)
- Interviewer (service provider)

There needs to be two separate user experiences: one for the students and one for the interviewers.
